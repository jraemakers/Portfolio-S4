## Introduction

In this portfolio I will show you my work for the Smart Mobile semester, which is about creating mobile applications. I will show you my work, what I have learned and how I have achieved the learning outcomes.

## Learning outcomes

In this table we put all the learning outcomes with links to proof that I have achieved them.
| Learning Outcome | Discription | Proof |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1. Analysis | You show you can convert a problem or opportunity into multiple smart mobile concepts based on thorough analysis. | [Go to proof](./Portfolio/Analysis.md) |
| 2. Advice | Based on relevant analysis, you advice on suitable user interaction and technological design, improvement of designs, research and/or methodology. | [Go to proof](./Portfolio/Advice.md) |
| 3. Design | You translate concepts into user friendly designs and validate these designs through user tested iterations. | [Go to proof](./Portfolio/Design.md) |

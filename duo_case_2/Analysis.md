### Tour de France and La Vuelta

These two apps are very similar in terms of functionality and design. One of them is the official app for the Tour de France, and the other is the official app for La Vuelta. The only difference between the two apps is the color scheme and the logo. When you open the app, you are greeted with a splash screen after that there is advertising for skoda. That is really annoying because you have to wait for the ad to finish before you can access the app. After the ad, you are taken to the home screen of the app. They have a bottom navigation bar with five tabs: Home, rankings, live, videos and menu. The home tab shows the latest news and updates about the Tour de France or La Vuelta. The rankings tab shows the current standings of the riders in the race. You can filter the rankings by different categories such as general classification, points classification, mountain classification and young rider classification. You can also see the rankings of the teams and individual stages. The live tab shows live updates and commentary during the race. The videos tab shows highlights and interviews. The menu tab has links to other sections of the app such as the schedule, route, teams, riders, etc. About every stage is little information about the start en finish location. Overall, the apps are well designed and easy to use and provide a good user experience for fans of the Tour de France and La Vuelta.

### Tour de France and La Vuelta

These two apps are very similar in terms of functionality and design. One of them is the official app for the Tour de France, and the other is the official app for La Vuelta. The only difference between the two apps is the color scheme and the logo. When you open the app, you are greeted with a splash screen after that there is advertising for skoda. That is really annoying because you have to wait for the ad to finish before you can access the app. After the ad, you are taken to the home screen of the app. They have a bottom navigation bar with five tabs: Home, rankings, live, videos and menu. The home tab shows the latest news and updates about the Tour de France or La Vuelta. The rankings tab shows the current standings of the riders in the race. You can filter the rankings by different categories such as general classification, points classification, mountain classification and young rider classification. You can also see the rankings of the teams and individual stages. The live tab shows live updates and commentary during the race. The videos tab shows highlights and interviews. The menu tab has links to other sections of the app such as the schedule, route, teams, riders, etc. About every stage is little information about the start en finish location. Overall, the apps are well designed and easy to use and provide a good user experience for fans of the Tour de France and La Vuelta.

### Giro d'Italia

At the homescreen of the Giro d'Italia app, you can see the different stages and news about the tour. The app has a bottom navigation bar with five tabs: Home, The route, Live, Leaderboard and Teams. The Route tab shows the route of the Giro d'Italia. You can see the start and finish locations of each stage and the distance and elevation of the stage. The Live tab shows live updates and commentary during the race. The Leaderboard tab shows the current overal standings and stage results. You can filter the leaderboard by different categories such as general classification, points classification, mountain classification and young rider classification. The Teams tab shows information about the teams and riders that are participating in the Giro d'Italia. The app is well designed and easy to use and provides a good user experience for fans of the Giro d'Italia.

### Tour Tracker

The Tour Tracker app has very much information about all the cycling races. It isn't very clear how to switch between the different races. The app has many tabs and it isn't very clear what each tab does. I think the app is a bit overwhelming for new users. The app has a lot of information that the user has to scroll through to find what they are looking for. It shows information about the rankings, stages, riders, news and live updates. Overall, the app has to much information in my opinion and it isn't very user friendly.

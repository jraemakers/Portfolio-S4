### Tech Case 9: A battery app for a global audience

As you can see the app is available in multiple languages. When Arabic is selected everything is mirrored. You can see the battery percentage using a progress bar. In the progress bar, multiple colors are used to show the battery percentage. You can find how long the battery will last and how long it will take to charge.

### Duo Case 5: Efficient remote working

When developing this app we tried to stick to the design as much as possible. We used widget to make the code more readable when needed. We also could have made the mood switcher more user friendly by making it more obvious that the user can slide it.

# Professional Skills

I hope to show you my professional development as a mobile developer in the form of this portfolio. I will show you my work and what I have learned. I will also show you how I have achieved the learning outcomes and how I have improved my skills. This portfolio will be a showcase of my professional development as a mobile developer. Stay tuned for more updates.

## Scrum

We used Scrum to keep track of our progress. We had a daily stand-up meeting to discuss what we had done, what we were going to do and if we had any problems. We also had a sprint review meeting to discuss what we had done and what we were going to do next. We also had a sprint retrospective meeting to discuss what went well and what could be improved.

### Scrum board

We used Jira to keep track of our progress.
